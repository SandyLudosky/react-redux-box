# React Redux Box

<img src="./box-img-lg.png" alt="react-redux box image" title="react-redux_logo" width="300" />

This box comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts from a react app and redux library for state management

You will need to install Node.js and Truffle, as stated in the tutorial - see "Setting up the development environment".


## To get this box ##

1. Create a new directory.

2. In the new directory, run ```truffle unbox SandyLudosky/react-redux-box```. This should pull the box contents to the new local directory.

## After unboxing ##

run :

```
npm install
```


In the main project directory:

```
truffle develop
```

Then, in the Truffle developer console: 
```
compile
```

and then:
```
migrate
```

To test your smart contract(s), in truffle's developer console:
```
test
```

Now that you have successfully launched your Solidity contract onto your local blockchain, go into the client directory:

Run the project by entering the following:

```
npm start
```

To see your project in the browser, go to http://localhost:3000/

You can test your DApp by entering the following:

```
npm test
```
